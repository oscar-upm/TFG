# PyMOL visualization

The linker backbones generated by RFdiffusion and their clustering were visualized using PyMOL.
To do this, PyMOL scripts were written to create selections of the linker residues in all RFdiffusion models (`select_linkers.py`) and create selections for each cluster of linkers (`view_clustering.py`). With these utils, linker cartoons could be represented and colored according to their cluster.
