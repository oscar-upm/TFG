# TFG

Code for Óscar Pérez Camacho's TFG at UPM.

The code is organized in several folders:

- `RFdiffusion`: generation of linker backbones using RFdiffusion.
- `linker_clustering`: hierarchical clustering and selection of linker prototypes.
- `ProteinMPNN`: inference of the linker prototypes' sequences using ProteinMPNN.
- `add_sidechains`: code to add the sidechains to the linker structures by homology modeling.

Each folder has a description explaining the purpose of its scripts.
